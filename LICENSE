# UNLICENSED!

These are resources to support my demo-sites and for my personal use.

Some I expect that I purchased, so I can't give you permission to use something that must be paid for.

Good deals to buy good resources can be done at HumbleBundle.com when they have a bundle available that meets your needs.  This is where I received many of mine.

At the moment, I'm testing how this works with my demo-sites.  I'm also going to test if I can make this repo private and still host it, but I expect not.

So I may make radical changes soon.
